<!--
I understand this isnt the full website, I have done the parts that are most challenging to myself
and I have learnt a lot from it. I would like some feedbackon the code present, maybe there is an
easier way for me to have achieved this. This topic has proved itself to be very difficult to me
for a multitude of reasons but at the moment I have my end of term assignments for highschool
and being in australia makes it hard to collaborate. I hope you can undertsand that I have given
it a crack and left out the bits I am confident in.If you advise that I finish the project I will
but for now i will be turning my attention elsewhere, thankyou -Tynan
